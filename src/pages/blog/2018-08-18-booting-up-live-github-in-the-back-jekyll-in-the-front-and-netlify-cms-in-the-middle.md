  Time to deploy this Netlify CMS demo!


  Push everything to GitHub and go to http://netlify.com. Don't worry; if your
  project is open source, everything is free. :)

![Login through GitHub and you will see the React-powered editor:](/img/flavor_wheel.jpg)

If you add a new product, it will be pushed to the GitHub repo, and the build will be triggered.



And that's it!



This leaves us with some pretty cool JAM:



Light & fast static e-commerce site with Jekyll & Snipcart

Secure & version-controlled content repository in GitHub

Lightweight & extendable content management in Netlify CMS

Automated build & deployments with Netlify's platform

Both developers & non-technical folks should be happy with this set up. Job's done!
